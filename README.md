## Abstract

Household roles are critical determinants of married couples’ subjective well-being. One strand of the literature, focusing on income division, finds that couples experience higher well-being when husbands earn more than their wives. The other strand examines the well-being implications of housework division, with mixed results. The present study synthesizes these perspectives by analyzing how combined household roles—incorporating both income and household labor divisions—relate to life satisfaction. Using longitudinal dyadic data from 12,980 couples surveyed in the China Family Panel Studies (2010–2022), results reveal that traditional income arrangements, with husbands as primary earners, consistently associate with higher life satisfaction for both spouses. This pattern is evident both between couples and, particularly among husbands, during transitions into such roles over time, and becomes especially pronounced when husbands also contribute significantly to housework. Notably, a small subgroup of husbands reports higher satisfaction within non-traditional arrangements, wherein wives are primary earners and husbands handle most household chores. For wives, transitioning into a double-burden role significantly reduces their life satisfaction. These findings illustrate both continuity with and departure from traditional gender norms in China, suggesting non-traditional household roles as emerging pathways that may enhance well-being.
