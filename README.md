## Abstract

Household roles are critical determinants of married couples’ subjective well-being. One strand of the literature, focusing on income division, finds that husbands earning more than their wives positively influences couples’ subjective well-being. The other strand examines the well-being implications of housework division, with mixed results. The present study synthesizes the literature, investigating how household roles—a combination of income and housework divisions—are associated with couples’ life satisfaction. Using a longitudinal dyadic sample of 12,980 couples from the China Family Panel Studies (2010-2022), results show that traditional income arrangements, wherein husbands are the primary earners, consistently associate with higher life satisfaction for both spouses. This pattern emerges both when comparing across couples and, particularly for husbands, when observing transitions into such roles over time within the same couple. This satisfaction premium appears strongest when husbands also contribute a larger share of housework. Additionally, a small subgroup of husbands reports higher life satisfaction in non-traditional roles, where wives are the primary earners and husbands perform the majority of housework. These findings highlight both continuity with and divergence from traditional gender norms in China, suggesting non-traditional household roles as emerging pathways to enhance well-being.
