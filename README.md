## Abstract

Household roles have been established as critical determinants of married couples' subjective well-being. One strand of the literature, focusing on income division, finds that husbands earning more than their wives positively influences couples' subjective well-being. The other strand examines the well-being implications of housework division, with mixed results. The present study synthesizes the literature, investigating how household roles—a combination of income and housework divisions—are associated with couples' life satisfaction. Using longitudinal dyadic data (N = 5,156 pairs of married couples) from the China Family Panel Studies, results show that, contrary to the normative expectations, husbands were more satisfied with life when their wives earned more than they did, while wives reported higher life satisfaction when husbands contributed more income and housework. Additionally, the well-being gap within couples was most pronounced in favor of husbands when wives contribute more to both income and housework. These findings challenge the assumed advantages of traditional gender norms and reveal more complex dynamics at play, suggesting that within-couple dynamics in household income and labor divisions are diverse and have varied impacts on subjective well-being.
